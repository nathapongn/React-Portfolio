                Nimbus stands out as the most challenging and intricate personal design project I've undertaken. From initial scoping to countless sketching iterations, the process required an additional level of depth and precision. Designing for both light and dark modes for the first time demanded a highly systematic approach to primitives and semantic tokenization.
                
                This project was also one of the most iterative I've ever worked on, often requiring me to revisit the drawing board more than I anticipated.

                Ultimately, the experience profoundly shaped my growth as a designer. It improved my ability to approach projects with a structured mindset, significantly enhancing how I tackle design challenges in my professional practice."
